# Exploring-Home-Ownership-with-Support-Vector-Machines
This project aims to analyze factors influencing home ownership using support vector machines (SVM) on survey data from the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS USA). The primary objective is to build predictive models that accurately estimate home ownership status and uncover key societal challenges related to housing.
